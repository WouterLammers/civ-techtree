A simple tool to help deciding what to research next in FreeCiv.

This tool is an experiment I made while playing a FreeCiv marathon. It shows (a part of) the whole research tree. You can inspect each choice to see what it would yield. You can also specify a 'goal' and see the exact path of all necessary research still to do. Use the 'h' key to see all other commands like zooming and saving/loading often used positions.

Here is a link to see it in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mhuMOAQK0o

The code is definitely not industry-strength! (It always surprises me how much more work coding properly really is..) I've put it on Github just in case it might serve to help or inspire someone else.
